Formatting the electronic book Get Things Done 1 (Chinese version), only main tex file are provided


Build tip
---------
Use XeLaTeX. TeXLive 2014 is recommended.

This book utilized Source Han Sans CN (a.k.a Noto Sans CN) and Open Sans as font-face, they are both free to fetch.

Currently (Aug 15, 2014) the xdvipdfmx that comes with TeXLive 2014 is unable to properly handle the Source Han Sans font-face. A patch is available for this issue.
